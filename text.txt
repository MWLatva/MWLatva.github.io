<p>The Sunlab cow was created by Tony Monroe in 1999 as 
                    a part of a command line tool "cowsay" and has become an icon in programming. 
                    Known for its friendly demeanor, the cow has been widely embraced in the computing.
                    Even before Lehigh, the cow's simplicity and charm have made it a lasting symbol of
                    command-line humor.</p>
